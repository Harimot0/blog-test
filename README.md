# Self Introduction

Hi, I am Samuel Cheung, Now I officially opened blog on Github.

Before this, I have a little iOS development experience. 

I like Swift programming language.

```Swift
public func boot(_ app: Application) throws {
  // Your code here
}
```

Also, I have a little Web development experience.

In spare time, I read some books and watch videos, and learn some Japanese.

That's all about me.
